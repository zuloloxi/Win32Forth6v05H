You now need to recompile your NDX file.  Click on hYper
above and select Build.  Then exit the program.

Tip: If you get too many false hits for links to definitions
try moving the block of text under META.F down to the bottom
and then do the same with SEE.F.  (You can do this from the
WinEd by opening WinEd.NDX)

You can do this to other files you may find troublesome as well.

Reinstalling?  If you are resinstalling after having another
version of Win32Forth (even if you previously uninstalled)
click on Search --> Find Text In Files and make sure the
search subdirectories check box is NOT selected.  Then Close
the dialog.  This allows you to skip the WinEd source files 
in the hyper index file.
