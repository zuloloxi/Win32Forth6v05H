\ CALTIMER sets up a timer structure
\ PREMATURE? is false only after the designated time has elapsed

\ We use this scheme to guarantee a minimum time between periodic events,
\ so as to limit their impact on CPU time.

\ This scheme lends itself to low performance multitasking where the time is
\ tested at a relatively low frequency like 10 to 100 Hz.
