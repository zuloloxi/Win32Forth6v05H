Term.c  problem with registry - console settings

Changed to use the default setings 3,3,634,474 when the Console key is not present (as on a new computer) in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Win32For\Settings.
Previously when this key could not be found some random console sizes were produced and they were expecting 0 for the height to select the default settings.
